# Algorithm_p1
Group members: Arqum Ahmed and Yesh Patel

Objective: 
You have a row of 2𝑛 disks of two colors,𝑛 dark and 𝑛 light. They alternate: dark, light, dark, light,
and so on. You want to get all the dark disks to the left-hand end, and all the light disks to the
right-hand end. The only moves you are allowed to make are those that interchange the positions of
two neighboring disks. Design an algorithm for solving this puzzle and determine the number of
moves it takes.

1. disks.hpp is a C++ header that defines functions for the two algorithms described above. There
are also classes that represent the input and output of the alternating disk problem. The function
definitions are incomplete skeletons; you will need to rewrite them to actually work properly

2. disks_test.cpp is a C++ program with a main() function that performs unit tests on the
functions defined in disks.hpp to see whether they work, prints out the outcome, and calculates
a score for the code. You can run this program to see whether your algorithm implementations are
working correctly.

Implement all the skeleton functions in disks.hpp. Use the disks_test.cpp program to
test whether your code works.
